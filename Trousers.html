<h2 class="left">A Beginner's Guide To: Trousers</h2>
    <p class="bodytext">Everyone is human, we all put our trousers on leg at a time, but finding the exact right pair can be the challenge.
    <br>Here, we will do our best to get you started by trying to find at least three pairs of trousers to get your basic wardrobe started up.</p>
<h3 class="subheading">Grey Flannels</h3>
<blockquote class="quote"> <p>"The only pair of trousers a guy needs are grey flannel."</p>

<p class="bodytext">
	Worn by men throughout time, grey flannel trousers are a surefire bet to strike the balance for anywhere from smart casual to even formal occasions.
	<br>Be sure to opt for a tapered cut, and avoid pleats at all costs!
	<br>Grey flannel trousers are a wardrobe essential, being able to be incorporated into wildly differing aesthetics from rugged workwear or Americana and even Ivy or the more insufferably foppish stylings of the #menswear subculture.

<h3 class="subheading">Indigo Raw Denim</h3>
	<p class="bodytext">
		Unwashed, unsanforized "raw" denim is a far more personal experience, allowing your jeans to break in to your body and create an almost custom fit.
		<br>Opt for a dark wash indigo or black, and make sure to wash them as rarely as possible to ensure stark contrast of fades once worn in.
		<br>For a good starting point, go for an <a href="https://theunbrandedbrand.com/products/ub101-skinny-fit-indigo-selvedge?variant=367833559">Unbranded UB101.</a>
		<br>If you're willing to go for a more expensive entry point, opt for <a href="https://www.3sixteen.com/collections/denim/products/st-120x-slim-leg-shadow-selvedge-denim">3Sixteen's ST-120x.</a>

<h3 class="subheading">Khaki Chinos</h3>
<p class="bodytext">
The workhorse of any business casual wardrobe, a good pair of chinos is essential to any wardrobe.
<br>For a more trad fit, aim for a tapered leg, but a full rise to sit at the natural waist and more flattering proportions.
<br>While this fit is hard to find in the modern market, <a href="https://www.jcrew.com/p/mens_category/pants/484/essential-chino-pant-in-484-slim-fit/53368"> J. Crew's Essential Chino</a> gives a fuller rise while still having a modern silouhette.
